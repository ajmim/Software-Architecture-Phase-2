### Description of the project
In the context of our Software Architecture course at the Information System Master at HEC Lausanne, we worked on a creating a web application using Java Framework (JavaServer Faces JSF).
This is phase one of the project, focusing on implementing core features and views. We use the MVC model.

## Challenges
- Implementing MVC architecture for the first time can be challenging due to the need to understand the separation of concerns and the data flow between the Model, View, and Controller.
- Creating a database as a class and correctly using heritage notions.
- Understanding static variables.

## Achievement
The code runs successfuly and we can continue working on [the third phase of the project](https://github.com/ajmim/Software-Architecture-Phase-3).
